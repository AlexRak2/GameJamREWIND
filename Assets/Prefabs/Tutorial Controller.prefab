  tutorialText:
  - The dark plants kills on touch.
  - Jump over gaps with the awesome space key.
  - Clicking right mouse will rewind time and the plants will shrink, possibly opening
    new paths.
  - You will have to gather all the keys to get through this door. Have a look around.
  - Enemies will leave you alone unless you get quite close. But they are more aggressive
    when you are rewinding time.
  - Cast a fireball by click left mouse button. Shoot the enemy to stun him.
  - 'Keep in mind, enemies will eventually come back to return to conciousness if
    you rewind for too long. '
  - Vines with large leaves can be used as a platform.
